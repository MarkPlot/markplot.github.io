> There was clearly nothing to do but flop down on the shabby little couch and howl. So @@Della did it. Which instigates the moral reflection that life is made up of sobs, sniffles, and smiles, with sniffles predominating.

> @@Della[finished her cry and attended to her cheeks with the powder rag. She stood by the window and looked out dully at a grey cat walking a grey fence in a grey backyard]. To-morrow would be @@Christmas_Day, and she had only $1.87 with which to buy @@Jim a present. @@(Della)[She had been saving every penny she could for months, with this result.] Twenty dollars a week doesn’t go far. Expenses had been greater than she had calculated. They always are. Only $1.87 to buy a present for @@Jim. @@(Della)Her @@Jim. Many a happy hour she had spent planning for something nice for @@(Jim)him. Something fine and rare and sterling—something just a little bit near to being worthy of the honour of being owned by @@Jim.

> There was a pier-glass between the windows of the room. Perhaps you have seen a pier-glass in an $8 flat. A very thin and very agile person may, by observing his reflection in a rapid sequence of longitudinal strips, obtain a fairly accurate conception of his looks. @@Della, being slender, had mastered the art.
- `../../examples/01-TheGiftOfTheMagi-O.Henri/The_Gift_of_the_Magi.md:24` with modifiers: she whirled from the window and stood before the glass. Her eyes were shining brilliantly, but her face had lost its colour within twenty seconds. Rapidly she pulled down her hair and let it fall to its full length.

> Now, there were two possessions of the @@(Jim)[James Dillingham Youngs] in which they both took a mighty pride. One was @@(The_Watch).Object[@@Jim’s gold watch that had been his father’s and his grandfather’s]. The other was @@(Hair)[@@Della’s hair. Had the Queen of Sheba lived in the flat across the airshaft, @@Della would have let her hair hang out the window some day to dry just to depreciate Her Majesty’s jewels and gifts.] @@(The_Watch)[King Solomon been the janitor, with all his treasures piled up in the basement, @@Jim would have pulled out watch every time he passed, just to see him pluck at his beard from envy.]

> @@(Hair)[So now @@Della’s beautiful hair fell about her, rippling and shining like a cascade of brown waters. It reached below her knee and made itself almost a garment for her. And then she did it up again nervously and quickly. Once she faltered for a minute and stood still while a tear or two splashed on the worn red carpet.]

> @@(Della)She found @@(Chain).Object[it at last. It surely had been made for @@Jim and no one else. There was no other like it in any of the stores, and she had turned all of them inside out. It was a platinum fob chain simple and chaste in design, properly proclaiming its value by substance alone and not by meretricious ornamentation—as all good things should do. It was even worthy of @@The_Watch. As soon as she saw it she knew that it must be @@Jim’s. It was like him. Quietness and value—the description applied to both. Twenty-one dollars they took from her for it, and she hurried home with the 87 cents. With that chain on his watch @@Jim might be properly anxious about the time in any company. Grand as the watch was, he sometimes looked at it on the sly on account of the old leather strap that he used in place of a chain.]
- `../../examples/01-TheGiftOfTheMagi-O.Henri/The_Gift_of_the_Magi.md:51`
> When @@Della reached home her intoxication gave way a little to prudence and reason. She got out her curling irons and lighted the gas and went to work repairing the ravages made by generosity added to love. Which is always a tremendous task, dear friends—a mammoth task.
- `../../examples/01-TheGiftOfTheMagi-O.Henri/The_Gift_of_the_Magi.md:53`
> Within forty minutes @@(Della)her head was covered with tiny, close-lying curls that made her look wonderfully like a truant schoolboy. @@(Della)She looked at her reflection in the mirror long, carefully, and critically.

> “If @@Jim doesn’t kill me,” @@(Della)she said to herself, “before he takes a second look at me, he’ll say I look like a Coney Island chorus girl. But what could I do—oh! what could I do with a dollar and eighty-seven cents?”
- `../../examples/01-TheGiftOfTheMagi-O.Henri/The_Gift_of_the_Magi.md:59`
> @@Jim[was never late]. @@Della doubled the fob chain in her hand and sat on the corner of the table near the door that he always entered. Then she heard his step on the stair away down on the first flight, and she turned white for just a moment. She had a habit of saying little silent prayers about the simplest everyday things, and now she whispered: “Please God, make him think I am still pretty.”
- `../../examples/01-TheGiftOfTheMagi-O.Henri/The_Gift_of_the_Magi.md:65`
> @@Jim stopped inside the door, as immovable as a setter at the scent of quail. His eyes were fixed upon @@Della, and there was an expression in them that she could not read, and it terrified her. It was not anger, nor surprise, nor disapproval, nor horror, nor any of the sentiments that she had been prepared for. He simply stared at her fixedly with that peculiar expression on his face.
- `../../examples/01-TheGiftOfTheMagi-O.Henri/The_Gift_of_the_Magi.md:67`
> @@Della wriggled off the table and went for him.
- `../../examples/01-TheGiftOfTheMagi-O.Henri/The_Gift_of_the_Magi.md:69`
> “@@Jim, darling,” @@(Della)she cried, “don’t look at me that way. I had my hair cut off and sold it because I couldn’t have lived through Christmas without giving you a present. It’ll grow out again—you won’t mind, will you? I just had to do it. My hair grows awfully fast. Say ‘Merry Chistmas!’ Jim, and let’s be happy. You don’t know what a nice—what a beautiful, nice gift I’ve got for you.”
- `../../examples/01-TheGiftOfTheMagi-O.Henri/The_Gift_of_the_Magi.md:73`
> “Cut it off and sold it,” said @@Della. “Don’t you like me just as well, anyhow? I’m me without my hair, ain’t I?”
- `../../examples/01-TheGiftOfTheMagi-O.Henri/The_Gift_of_the_Magi.md:79`
> “You needn’t look for it,” said @@Della. “It’s sold, I tell you—sold and gone, too. It’s Christmas Eve, boy. Be good to me, for it went for you. Maybe the hairs of my head were numbered,” she went on with a sudden serious sweetness, “but nobody could ever count my love for you. Shall I put the chops on, @@Jim?”
- `../../examples/01-TheGiftOfTheMagi-O.Henri/The_Gift_of_the_Magi.md:82`
> Out of his trance @@Jim seemed quickly to wake. He enfolded his @@Della. For ten seconds let us regard with discreet scrutiny some inconsequential object in the other direction. Eight dollars a week or a million a year—what is the difference? A mathematician or a wit would give you the wrong answer. The magi brought valuable gifts, but that was not among them. This dark assertion will be illuminated later on.

> For there lay The Combs—the set of combs, side and back, that @@Della had worshipped for long in a Broadway window. Beautiful combs, pure tortoise shell, with jewelled rims—just the shade to wear in the beautiful vanished @(Hair)hair. They were expensive combs, she knew, and her heart had simply craved and yearned over them without the least hope of possession. And now, they were hers, but the tresses that should have adorned the coveted adornments were gone.
- `../../examples/01-TheGiftOfTheMagi-O.Henri/The_Gift_of_the_Magi.md:92`
> But @@(Della)she hugged them to her bosom, and at length she was able to look up with dim eyes and a smile and say: “My hair grows so fast, @@Jim!”
- `../../examples/01-TheGiftOfTheMagi-O.Henri/The_Gift_of_the_Magi.md:94`
> And then @@Della leaped up like a little singed cat and cried, “Oh, oh!”
- `../../examples/01-TheGiftOfTheMagi-O.Henri/The_Gift_of_the_Magi.md:96`
> @@Jim had not yet seen his beautiful present. @@(Della)She held it out to him eagerly upon her open palm. The dull precious metal seemed to flash with a reflection of her bright and ardent spirit.
- `../../examples/01-TheGiftOfTheMagi-O.Henri/The_Gift_of_the_Magi.md:102`
> “@@(Della)Dell,” said @@(Jim)he, “let’s put our @@Christmas presents away and keep ’em a while. They’re too nice to use just at present. I sold the @@(The_Watch)watch to get the money to buy your combs. And now suppose you put the chops on.”
