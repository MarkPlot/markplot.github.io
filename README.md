# MarkPlot

> A lightweight semantic annotation language for writers

## TL;DR

MarkPlot is a lightweight semantic annotation language that allows writers to organize their creative work directly within their text. It offers a simple syntax to track characters, locations, plot elements and their relationships, without interrupting the writing flow. Compatible with standard text editors and Markdown, MarkPlot naturally integrates into the creative process while providing a structured view of the work. The annotations remain optional and human-readable, enabling authors to focus on their content while maintaining clear organization when needed.

## Getting Started

For a comprehensive introduction, documentation and guides, please visit the **[MarkPlot official website](https://markplot.github.io)**.

## Quick Example

```markplot
@@Jules smiled at @@(Marie).age(25)her while she was reading.
```

In this example, "Jules" is a visible entity and "Marie" is an hidden on entity with a modfier (`age`) with a hidden parameter (`25`), while readers simply see:

> Jules smiled at her while she was reading.
