# MarkScribe
> A lightweight annotation language for writers

## What is MarkScribe?

MarkScribe is a simple yet powerful annotation language that helps writers organize their story elements directly within their text. No more switching between multiple documents or breaking your writing flow to check character details or plot points.

```markscribe

```
