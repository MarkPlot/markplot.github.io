## Welcome to MarkPlot!

MarkPlot is a semantic annotation language that extends Markdown to help you keep track of characters, places, events, and relationships in your creative writing. Let's dive in!

## Where to start?

As MarkPlot is _only_ a annotation langage, it does not do much by itself. Your first step as a writer should be to choose a tool that supports it and fits your needs. As MarkPlot is still very new, curently, there is none. Sorry. Please come back later. [Drop me a email](mailto:mail@stephanemourey.fr?subject=Sign%20up%20for%2%MarkPlot%20updates) if you want to get an update. I promise I won't use it for anything else. Or, if you are also a coder, you may want to implement MarkPlot in existing tool or a new one. In this case, please have look to [the complete specifications](specifications.html).

## What is Markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you probably already know. It uses simple symbols to format text:

```markdown
# Heading
**Bold text**
*Italic text*
[Link](https://example.com)
```

If you're new to Markdown, you can check out the [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) for the basics. But this is not a requirement to start using MarkPlot right now.

## The 5-Minute MarkPlot Basics

### 1. Annotate Entities (Characters, Places, Moments or whatever)

```markplot
@@Sherlock examined the crime scene at @@Baker_Street.
```

**Result for readers:**
> Sherlock examined the crime scene at Baker Street.

**Behind the scenes:**
MarkPlot-enabled tools can automatically generate entity cards:

```markplot
# Sherlock
- Type: Character
- Appearances: Chapter 1, Chapter 3
- Related to: Watson, Lestrade
```

### 2. Make Entities invisible in Text

Want to hide the entity name in your text but mark its presence? Add parentheses:

```markplot
@@(Sherlock)He examined the crime scene at @@Baker_Street.
```

**Result for readers:**
> He examined the crime scene at Baker Street.

**Behind the scenes:**
The entity is still tracked, but its name is now hidden in the narrative text.

### 3. Add Visible Details with Modifier Parameters

Want to show additional information about a character in the text? Use square brackets:

```markplot
The @@(Watson).PROFESSION[Doctor] assisted with the investigation.
```

**Result for readers:**
> The Doctor assisted with the investigation.

**Behind the scenes:**
The information is stored in Watson's entity card:

```markplot
# Watson
- Type: Character
- Profession: Doctor
- Appearances: Chapter 1
```

### 4. Store Hidden Metadata

Use parentheses to store information that doesn't appear in the text:

```markplot
The @@(Watson).age(35).PROFESSION[military doctor] served in Afghanistan.
```

**Result for readers:**
> The military doctor served in Afghanistan.

**Behind the scenes:**
```markplot
# Watson
- Type: Character
- Age: 35
- Profession: military doctor
- Appearances: Chapter 1
```

### 5. Track Timeline and Events

Dates are special entities that help you manage your story's timeline:

```markplot
@@(1891-05-04) It was a foggy London morning when @@(Lestrade) arrived with news.
```

**Result for readers:**
> It was a foggy London morning when arrived with news.

**Behind the scenes:**
MarkPlot-enabled tools can generate chronological timelines:

```markplot
# Timeline
- 1891-05-04: Lestrade arrives with news (Chapter 2)
- 1891-05-05: The investigation begins (Chapter 3)
```

### 6. Indicate Point of View

Use modifiers to show whose perspective a scene is from:

```markplot
## Chapter 1 @@(Watson).Pov

I had not seen @@Holmes for several days...
```

**Result for readers:**
> ## Chapter 1
>
> I had not seen Holmes for several days...

**Behind the scenes:**
MarkPlot-enabled tools track narrative structure:

```markplot
# Narrative Structure
- Chapter 1: Watson's POV
```


## A Complete Example

```markplot
# A Study in Annotation @@.GENRE[mystery]

## Chapter 1 @@(Watson).Pov

@@(London) @@(1881-03-04)

I had just returned from @@Afghanistan when I met a @@(Holmes).PROFESSION[consulting detective] through a mutual acquaintance. He was looking for someone to share his lodgings at a @@(221B_Baker_Street).Place[comfortable apartment].

"You have been in @@Afghanistan.Place, I perceive," were his first words to me, leaving me quite astonished at his insight.
```

**Result for readers:**
> # A Study in Annotation
>
> ## Chapter 1
>
> I had just returned from Afghanistan when I met a consulting detective through a mutual acquaintance. He was looking for someone to share his lodgings at a comfortable apartment.
>
> "You have been in Afghanistan, I perceive," were his first words to me, leaving me quite astonished at his insight.

**Behind the scenes:**
MarkPlot-enabled tools would generate:
- Entity cards for Watson, Holmes, London, Afghanistan, and 221B Baker Street
- A timeline entry for March 4, 1881
- Genre categorization for the document
- POV tracking for chapters

## What's Next?

- **Combine with Markdown**: Use all standard Markdown features alongside MarkPlot annotations
- **Explore Modifiers**: Try `.mood()`, `.Status()`, or create your own
- **Build Your World**: Create a consistent set of characters, places, and events
- **Structure Your Narrative**: Use annotations to track plot arcs and themes
- **Use Tools**: Check out compatible editors and visualization tools

## Tips

- Develop a consistent annotation style for your project
- Use annotations sparingly at firstâ€”you can always add more later
- Consider creating a simple legend of your most-used annotations
- Remember that MarkPlot annotations can be completely hidden from your final reader
- Use visible parameters `[]` when you want the information to appear in your text
- Use invisible parameters `()` when you want to store metadata only
