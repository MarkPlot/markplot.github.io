> A lightweight annotation language for writers

## TL;DR

MarkPlot is a lightweight semantic annotation language that allows writers to organize their creative work directly within their text. It offers a simple syntax to track characters, locations, plot elements and their relationships, without interrupting the writing flow. Compatible with standard text editors and Markdown, MarkPlot naturally integrates into the creative process while providing a structured view of the work. The annotations remain optional and human-readable, enabling authors to focus on their content while maintaining clear organization when needed.

If you are a writer, you might want to read the [Quick start](QuickStart.html) first.

## Why MarkPlot ?

The story below, in MarkPlot !

```markplot
## Why @@MarkPlot? @@(me).pov

As a @@(me).HOBBY[writer], I found myself drowning in character sheets, timeline
documents, and location descriptions scattered across multiple files and tools.

@@(MarkPlot).WHY[Every time I needed to check a detail about a character, a
specific place, an event, I had to break my writing flow to search through my
notes.]
When and where @@Jules and @@Isabelle met for the first time?

@@(MarkPlot).HOW[I needed a way to keep track of all these elements right within
my manuscript, something that wouldn't force me to leave my text editor or
interrupt my creative process].

That's how @@(MarkPlot).WHAT[the idea of a simple, inline annotation system] was
born - not as another writing tool, but as a _natural_ extension of the writing
process itself.]

As a @@(me).JOB[coder], I would now be able to write tools that could understand my narrative elements, analyze my story structure, and help me visualize my
characters' relationships.
I could even generate character sheets, timelines, and location maps
automatically from my text.

The possibilities are endless.

## What is MarkPlot?

MarkPlot is a simple yet powerful annotation language that helps writers organize their story elements directly within their text. No more switching between multiple documents or breaking your writing flow to check character details or plot points.
