# Specifications

This document presents the complete technical specifications of the MarkPlot language, detailing its syntax, features, and implementation principles. These specifications are intended for developers wishing to create tools compatible with MarkPlot, as well as for writers seeking to fully understand the language's capabilities for managing characters, plots, timelines, and other narrative elements. The current status of these specifications is preliminary (draft) and subject to evolution.

## 1. Core Syntax

### 1.1 Entities

At the heart of MarkPlot, there are **entities**. Entities are created, then referenced, using two _at_ signs `@@` followed by the entity name. Those signs will be removed from the final text output (hereinafter called _final text_), _but usefull before to provide semantic analysis during writing_.

So this code:
```@@Jules looked at @@Mary.```

is rendered as follows the final text:

>Jules looked at Mary.

---

An entity can be any narrative element that you want to track, analyze, or reference throughout your text - characters, locations, objects, events... By marking these elements as entities, you create a rich semantic layer that tools can use to many purposes, for examples:

- Build character profiles and relationship networks
- Generate timelines and event sequences
- Maintain consistency across your story

This semantic layer remains invisible to readers while providing powerful capabilities for writers and tools.

---

An entity may be referenced without appearing in the final text, by wrapping its name with parenthesis `@@(Entity)`:
```markplot
@@(Gandalf)The wizard raised his hands.
```
> The wizard raised his hands.

In this case, it is called a _hidden entity_ (as opposed to a _visible entity_).

This is usefull for referencing an entity when it appears in a way other than its name.

---

Entity names:
- Can contain letters (including Unicode letters from any language), digits (0-9) and underscores
- Are case-sensitive
- MUST NOT start with a digit, as this syntax is reserved for temporal entities (see §2.3.4.5)
- MUST NOT contain spaces, use underscores instead (which are replaced by spaces in the final text)

```markplot
@@HMS_Macon references a rigid airship build and operated by the United States Navy.
```
> HMS Macon references a rigid airship build and operated by the United States Navy.

---

### 1.2 Entity and Content Capture

Content capture is a core mechanism in MarkPlot that associates that associates the entity and the context where it appears. By default, it captures the whole sentence.

```markplot
@@Jules was walking down the street. @@Mary was sitting on the terrace of a cafe. @@(Jules)@@(Mary)Then they saw each other.
```
The first sentence is associated with Jules, the second with Mary and the third with both.

---

Sometimes you need precise control over what content is associated with an entity, to capture parts smaller or wider than the sentence, or even multi-lines content. This is where explicit content capture using square brackets `[...]` comes in:

```markplot
@@Jules[only these words] are captured, not the whole sentence.
@@Jules[picked up the letter and read:
  "Dear Mary,
  I hope this finds you well..."
].
```
Note: Brackets MUST immediately follow the entity name (no space allowed).

---

To ensure natural text flow while maintaining proper punctuation rules, when an entity is followed by bracketed content, the space between the entity name and the content is handled according to these rules:

1. If the content begins with a punctuation mark (`,.;:!?`), no space is added:
```markplot
@@Mary[, smiling,] continued her way.
```
> Mary, smiling, continued her way.

2. In all other cases, a space is automatically added:
```markplot
@@Jules[took his car].
```
> Jules took his car.

---

### 1.3 Entity Modifiers

Entity modifiers allow you to add attributes and metadata to entities using dot notation. These modifiers can be temporary states, permanent traits, or standard features.

```markplot
@@Jules.Pov             # Simple modifier
```

---

#### 1.3.1 Types of Modifiers

MarkPlot supports three distinct categories of modifiers:

1. **local modifiers** (lowercase `.modifier`)
   - Must start with a lowercase letter
   - Represent temporary or contextual attributes
   - Example: `.happy`, `.injured`, `.angry`

---

2. **GLOBAL modifiers** (uppercase `.MODIFIER`)
   - Must contain only uppercase letters
   - Define permanent characteristics
   - Example: `.NAME`, `.OCCUPATION`, `.BIRTHPLACE`

---

3. **Standard modifiers** (Title-case or Namespaced, see §2.3.4 and §2.3.5)
   - Built-in modifiers (Title-case):
     - Must start with a capital letter, followed by lowercase letters
     - Reserved for core MarkPlot features
     - Examples: `.Character`, `.Place`, `.Type`
   - Application modifiers (Namespaced):
     - Use registered namespace prefix followed by any name
     - Allow applications to extend the modifier system
     - Examples: `Writer:plot`, `Analysis:theme`

---

#### 1.3.2 Modifier Parameters

Modifiers use parentheses `()` to accept parameters. Unlike content captured with brackets (which appears in the final text), parameters are used for meta-information and configuration that should not appear in the narrative:

```markplot
# Parameters are meta-information
@@Jules.age(42)             # The number 42 won't appear in the text
@@.status(draft)            # Configuration that stays hidden
@@Jules is @@Marie.Rel(friend)['s best friend].  # Relationship info with visible text
```

The parameter content is passed as-is to the modifier implementation, which can parse it according to its own needs.

---

##### 1.3.2.1 Combining Modifiers
Modifiers can be combined freely (order does not affect semantic meaning):
```markplot
@@Holmes.PROFESSION(detective).mood(worried)
@@Watson.BACKGROUND(military).injured.tired
```
and in any order:
```markplot
@@Jules.Character.happy.NAME(Durant)  # Semantically equivalent to
@@Jules.happy.NAME(Durant).Character  # Semantically equivalent to
@@Jules.NAME(Durant).Character.happy
```

---

A parameter can be repeated if you like:
```
@@Jules.mood(sad).mood(embarassed) said something.
```

---



##### 1.3.2.2 Multi-line Parameters

Parameters can span multiple lines for better readability and organization:

```markplot
@@Jules.BACKGROUND(
  Born in Paris, 1985
  Education:
  - Sciences Po (2003-2006)
  - Stanford Law School (2006-2009)
  Career: International lawyer
)
```

Key points:
- Opening parenthesis must immediatly follow the modifier
- Content can span multiple lines

---

#### 1.3.3 Visibility Rules

Modifiers never appear in the final text:
```markplot
@@Jules.drunk[stumbled forward].
```
> Jules stumbled forward.

---

#### 1.3.4 Standard Modifiers

Standard modifiers are documented in `namespaces/global.yaml` following the same format as application-specific modifiers (see §2.3.5.4). The specification below provides an overview of core standard modifiers, but the authoritative reference is the YAML file.

---

##### 1.3.4.1 Reserved Capitalization

Modifiers starting with a capital letter (and not entirely uppercase, see §2.3.1) are reserved for standard MarkPlot features. Custom modifiers MUST start with a lowercase letter or be entirely uppercase.

---

##### 1.3.4.2 Core Standard Modifiers

- `.Type(type)`: Defines the entity type. Common types include: "character", "place", "event", "object", or may be whatever you want.
  - `.Character`: Sugar for `.Type(character)`
  - `.Place`: Sugar for `.Type(place)`
  - `.Object`: Sugar for `.Type(object)`
  - `.Event`: Sugar for `.Type(event)`
- `.Status(status)`: Indicates the status of the associated section.
  - `.Draft`: Sugar for `.Status(draft)`
  - `.Final`: Sugar for `.Status(final)`
- `.Todo(What is to do)`: indicates something to do.


---

- `.Version(version)`: Specifies the version of the associated section.

- `.Pov`: Indicates that the narrative follows the point of view of the entity.

Example usage:
```markplot
@@Jules.Character.Pov[looked at] @@Paris.Place.
@@.Draft
@@.Version(1.2)
```

---

Invalid usage (will be ignored and remains in the final text):
```markplot
@@Jules.Custom
```

---

##### 1.3.4.3 Standard Modifier Scope

The scope of standard modifiers is determined by their semantic nature:

- **Type Modifiers** (`.Type`, `.Character`, `.Place`, etc.): Global by default as they define the fundamental nature of entities

---

- **Status Modifiers** (`.Draft`, `.Final`): Local by default as they describe temporary states

---

- **Point of View Modifiers** (`.Pov`): Local by default as they typically apply to specific scenes or chapters

---

- **Version Modifiers** (`.Version`): Global by default as they apply to whole document sections

---

##### 1.3.4.4 Overriding Standard Modifier Scope

The default scope of any standard modifier can be explicitly overridden using scope indicators:
- `.Modifier!` forces global scope
- `.Modifier?` forces local scope

Examples:
```markplot
@@Jules.Character     # Global by default (type modifier)
@@Jules.Character?    # Forced local scope
@@Jules.Pov          # Local by default (POV modifier)
@@Jules.Pov!         # Forced global scope
```

When using scope overrides:
- The override applies only to the specific instance of the modifier
- The original semantic default remains unchanged for other uses
- Scope overrides must immediately follow the modifier name

#### 1.3.4.5 Temporal Entities

Temporal entities are a special type of entity that makes extensive use of standard modifiers to handle dates, times, and temporal relationships in your narrative. These entities are tightly integrated with the `.Type` modifier and its standard variants (`.Date`, `.Time`, `.DateTime`) to provide both implicit and explicit temporal typing.

---

While temporal entities have their own specific syntax formats (described below), they are recognized and processed through the standard modifier system. This integration allows for:
- Automatic type detection based on format (e.g., "2025-04-28" is recognized as a Date)
- Explicit typing when needed (e.g., `@@(2025-04-28).Type(Date)`)
- Consistent handling of temporal relationships and scopes
- Support for both standard and alternative calendar systems

---

A temporal entity can be either absolute (using standard calendar) or abstract (using relative time markers). In both cases, the temporal typing system ensures consistent processing and validation.

##### 1.3.4.5.1 Absolute Time

Absolute temporal entities use ISO 8601 format with space as datetime separator:

```markplot
@@(2025-04-28).Type(Date)              # Date only
@@(14:30:00+01:00).Type(Time)          # Time only
@@(2025-04-28 14:30:00+01:00).Type(DateTime)  # Full date and time
```

---

Shortened forms are allowed:
```markplot
@@(2025-04-28 14:30)     # Minutes precision
@@(2025-04)              # Month precision
@@(14:30)                # Time without timezone
```

---

The `.Type` modifier (`Date`, `Time`, or `DateTime`) is optional for temporal entities as they are automatically recognized by their format.

---

For dates before Common Era (BCE/BC), use the minus sign prefix following ISO 8601:
```markplot
@@(-0044-03-15)              # Ides of March, 44 BCE
@@(-0753-04-21)              # Founding of Rome
@@(-12000-01-01/GST)         # Event in alternative calendar BCE
```

---

Note:
- The year 1 BCE is represented as year 0000
- The year 2 BCE is represented as year -0001
- Years before 1 BCE must include leading zeros to maintain at least 4 digits
- The minus sign is only used for years, never for other units
- Time components remain unchanged regardless of era

---

Both space and 'T' separator are accepted for full ISO 8601 compatibility:
```markplot
@@(2025-04-28 14:30:00+01:00)  # Space separator (preferred for readability)
@@(2025-04-28T14:30:00+01:00)  # ISO 8601 T separator
```

---

##### 1.3.4.5.2 Abstract Time

Abstract temporal entities use special format with '@' prefix followed by level indicators (Y for year, M for month, D for day):

```markplot
@@(@Y1).Type(Date)              # Year 1
@@(@Y1-M3).Type(Date)           # Year 1, Month 3
@@(@Y1-M3-D12).Type(Date)       # Year 1, Month 3, Day 12
@@(@Y1-M3-D12 14:30).Type(DateTime)  # With time
```

---

Shortened forms focusing on specific units are allowed:
```markplot
@@(@D42 08:15)    # Day 42 at 08:15
@@(@D42)          # Just Day 42
```

---

##### 1.3.4.5.3 Alternative Calendars

Alternative calendar systems can be specified using a suffix:
```markplot
@@(3027-13-42/GST)           # Galactic Standard Time
```

Alternative calendar systems must follow standard numerical formatting:
- Years must use 4 or more digits
- Other units (months, days, hours, minutes, seconds) must use exactly 2 digits
- Month and day values can range from 01 to 99 to accommodate alternative calendars
- Time format remains HH:MM:SS with values from 00 to 99 for each unit

---

Examples:
```markplot
@@(3027-13-42/GST)           # Valid: month=13, day=42
@@(12345-99-99 99:99:99/GST) # Valid: all units using maximum values (except year, which has no maximum or minimal value)
@@(99:99/GST)                # Valid
@@(99:99)                    # Invalid with standard time system
@@(027-13-42/GST)            # Invalid: year less than 4 digits
@@(3027-4-12/GST)            # Invalid: month needs 2 digits
```

---

The extended range (up to 99) for all units provides flexibility for alternative calendar systems while maintaining a consistent, parseable format.

Time zones in alternative calendars follow the same format as standard time (±HH:MM) but allow values up to 99:
```markplot
@@(3027-13-42 14:30+23/GST)       # Valid: timezone offset of 23 hours
@@(3027-13-42 14:30+99:99/GST)    # Valid: maximum timezone offset
@@(3027-13-42 14:30+100:00/GST)   # Invalid: hours exceed 99
```

---

The extended range for timezone offsets (up to ±99:99) accommodates alternative calendar systems that might use different day lengths or time divisions while maintaining a consistent, parseable format.

---

##### 1.3.4.5.4 Temporal Scope

Temporal entities follow specific scope rules:

1. A temporal entity's scope extends until another temporal entity of the same or higher precision is encountered
2. Lower precision entities inherit context from higher precision entities in scope
3. Explicit scope using brackets overrides these rules

---

Example:
```markplot
@@(2025)[
  @@(04-28)[Morning events...]
  @@(14:30)[Afternoon specific event...]
  @@(19:00)[Evening events...]
]
@@(2026-01-01)[New year events...]
```

These scope rules allow for natural chronological organization while maintaining precision when needed.

##### 1.3.4.5.5 Integration Examples

Temporal entities can be combined with other MarkPlot features for rich narrative control:

```markplot
# Combining with characters and events
@@(1815-06-18).Type(Date)[On that fateful day,] @@Napoleon[faced his destiny at] @@Waterloo.Place.

# Using with nested annotations and modifiers
@@(1789-07-14)[The @@(Bastille).Type(Place)[fortress] fell as @@Paris.excited[erupted in revolution].

# Timeline organization with multiple entities
@@(@Y1)[In the first year,
  @@(@M3)[During the third month,] @@Jules.tired[struggled with] @@Writer_Block,
  but by @@(@M6)[summer] @@(Jules)[he] had @@.happy[finished the first draft].
]
```

These examples show how temporal entities work seamlessly with:
- Character entities and their modifiers
- Place entities and type annotations
- Nested entity references
- Local modifiers for narrative mood
- The null entity for contextual attributes

### 1.3.5 Application Specific Modifiers

Applications can define their own modifiers using namespaces.

#### 1.3.5.1 Namespace Definition

Application namespaces MUST:
- Consist of ASCII letters only (a-z, A-Z) and digits (0-9)
- End with a single colon (:)
- Be registered through the official registration process (see $2.3.5.4)
- MUST not be already registered
- Are case-insensitive (e.g., `Writer:` and `writer:` mean the same namespace)

Examples of valid namespaces:
- `App:`
- `Writer2:`

Invalid namespaces:
- `Pip-App:` (contains hyphen)
- `École:` (contains non-ASCII character)

#### 1.3.5.2 Modifier Syntax

Application-specific modifiers are formed by:
1. The registered namespace (including colon)
2. The modifier name (can use any capitalization)

Examples:
```markplot
@@Jules.App:plot        # App application's plot modifier
@@Marie.Writer:character   # Writer's companion character modifier
```

#### 1.3.5.3 Scope Rules

Application-specific modifiers follow the same scope rules as standard modifiers:
- Their default scope is determined by their documented semantic nature
- Scope can be overridden using ! (global) and ? (local) modifiers

Example:
```markplot
@@Jules.App:Plot        # Default scope (as documented by App)
@@Jules.App:Plot!       # Forced global scope
@@Jules.App:Plot?       # Forced local scope
```

Applications MUST document the default scope of their modifiers in their documentation.

#### 1.3.5.4 Modifier Documentation Format

Applications MUST document their modifiers using this standardized format:

```yaml
namespace: ApplicationNamespace
version: 1.0.0
status: [registered|draft]  # Status of this namespace registration
liveat: "https://example.com/live-documentation-url"  # URL to latest development version
application:
  name: "Application Full Name"
  url: "https://application.example.com"
publisher:
  name: "Publisher Name"
  url: "https://publisher.example.com"
maintainer:
  name: "Maintainer Name"
  contact: "maintainer@example.com"
documentation: "https://docs.example.com/modifiers"  # Stable documentation URL
modifiers:
  - name: modifierName
    description: Brief description of the modifier's purpose
    scope: [global|local]  # Default scope
    parameters:
      - name: paramName
        type: [string|number|date|...]
        required: [true|false]
        description: Parameter description
        values: [value1, value2]  # Optional: enumeration of valid values
    examples:
      - code: "@@Entity.ApplicationName:modifierName"
        description: "Basic usage example"
    notes: |
      Additional implementation notes or warnings
```

This format is used by all modifiers documentation, including standard modifiers (see `namespaces/global.yaml`).

#### 1.3.5.5 Documentation Requirements

- All registered namespaces MUST provide documentation in this format
- All modifiers in the namespace MUST be documented
- Version numbers MUST follow semantic versioning
- Breaking changes MUST increment the major version number

#### 1.3.5.6 Namespace Registration Process

To avoid conflicts and maintain consistency across the ecosystem, application developers MUST register their namespaces. The registration process is currently being defined and will be detailed in a future version of the specification.

Until the registration process is formalized:
- Developers SHOULD document their namespace choices in their application documentation
- Developers SHOULD check existing applications to avoid namespace conflicts

Note that once the official registration process is established:
- Previously used unregistered namespaces will NOT be automatically grandfathered
- Applications may need to migrate to newly assigned namespaces
- The registration process will be designed to minimize disruption to existing applications

#### 1.3.5.7 Registration Fees and Contributions

The namespace registration process is and will always remain **free** for everyone. This ensures that the MarkPlot ecosystem stays open and accessible to all developers, from individual open-source contributors to large companies.

However, if you are registering a namespace for a commercial/proprietary application, we kindly encourage (but do not require) a financial contribution to support the MarkPlot project's development and maintenance. These contributions help us:

- Maintain the registration infrastructure
- Improve the specification
- Develop reference implementations
- Create better documentation
- Support the community

Suggested contribution levels:
- Small businesses (annual revenue under 100,000 USD): 25-100 USD
- Medium businesses (annual revenue 100,000-1 million USD): 100-500 USD
- Large businesses (annual revenue over 1 million USD): 500+ USD

All contributions are voluntary and have no impact on the registration process or timeline. The namespace registration will be processed with the same attention and priority regardless of whether a contribution is made.

Contributing companies will be acknowledged (unless they prefer to remain anonymous) in our [SUPPORTERS.md](SUPPORTERS.md) file.

#### 1.3.6 Modifiers in Nested Annotations

When using modifiers with nested annotations, there are specific rules for how they apply:

1. **Local Scope**: Modifiers apply only to their directly associated entity, not to nested annotations:
```markplot
@@Jules.happy[looked at @@Marie[who smiled]]  # Only Jules is happy
@@Scene.dark[@@Jules[walked] past @@Marie]    # Only the Scene is dark
```

2. **Null Entity Exception**: Modifiers on the null entity affect the entire captured content, including nested annotations:
```markplot
@@.style.italic[This text and @@Jules[his words] are all italic]
@@.pov(Jules)[@@Marie[smiled] as @@(he)[he] entered]  # All from Jules' POV
```

3. **Cascading Effects**: While modifiers don't affect nested entities directly, tools can analyze the relationship between modifiers at different levels:
```markplot
@@Scene.night[@@Jules.tired[met] @@Marie.worried[near the bridge]]
# Tools can understand this is a night scene with tired and worried characters
```


#### 1.3.7 Modifier vs Punctuation

To avoid ambiguity between modifiers and regular text, MarkPlot follows specific rules for handling dots in the text:

1. **Modifier Identification**:
   A dot is considered a modifier separator if and only if:
   - It immediately follows an entity name or another modifier
   - It is immediately followed by an ASCII letter (a-z or A-Z)

2. **Punctuation Treatment**:
   A dot is treated as regular punctuation when:
   - Followed by a number (e.g., ".42")
   - Followed by an accented character (e.g., ".été")
   - Followed by punctuation or spaces
   - At the end of text
   - Part of sequences like ellipsis ("...")

Examples:
```markplot
# Valid modifiers
@@Jules.happy(smiled)        # .happy is a modifier
@@Jules.tired.sad           # Both .tired and .sad are modifiers

# Treated as punctuation
@@Jules.42(looked tired)     # .42 is regular text
@@Jules.été[was hot]         # .été is regular text
@@Jules.[was surprised]      # . is punctuation
@@Jules...and then          # ... is ellipsis punctuation
@@Jules.                    # . is sentence-ending punctuation
```

This permissive approach ensures that:
- Common punctuation patterns work naturally
- Typing mistakes don't break the text
- No complex error handling is needed
- Writers can use normal punctuation freely

### 1.5 Null Entity

While entities typically represent narrative elements (characters, places, events), there are cases where you want to apply modifiers or capture content without creating an actual entity. This is where the null entity `@@.` comes in.

The null entity is a special construct that:
- Can take any type of modifier
- Never appears in the final text
- Doesn't create entity relationships
- Is purely used for meta-information and processing instructions

For example:
```markplot
@@.special[This text is special] but no entity is created.
@@.draft(This section needs review)
@@.style.font[Text with custom font]
@@.skip[Content to be ignored in certain exports]
@@.metadata.author[John Smith]
```

The null entity is particularly useful for:
- Applying styling or formatting not supported by Markdown
- Adding processing directives
- Including editorial notes or status indicators
- Attaching metadata to sections of text
- Creating hidden document structure (see §2.7)

Because it doesn't create actual entity relationships, the null entity is perfect for adding meta-information that should influence processing but not narrative analysis:
```markplot
@@.status(draft)                      # Document status
@@.style.highlight[Important text]    # Visual formatting
@@.editorial(Needs revision)          # Editorial notes
@@.Type(chapter)[                     # Document structure
  @@Jules[entered] as @@Marie[left]  # Normal entity tracking
]
```

### 1.6 Annotation Scope

MarkPlot annotations follow specific scope rules depending on their placement and modifiers.

#### 1.6.1 File-level Annotations

Annotations at the very beginning of a file (before any content) apply to the entire file:
```markplot
@@.Author(John Doe)
@@.Version(1.0)
# First chapter
```

#### 1.6.2 Header Annotations

Apply to all content under that header until the next header of same or higher level:
```markplot
@@.(# Chapter 1).Pov(Jules)
This text is from Jules' point of view.
## Scene 1
Still from Jules' point of view.
# Chapter 2
New chapter, POV reset.
```

#### 1.6.3 Paragraph Annotations

Apply only to the immediately following paragraph:
```markplot
@@.(* Important theme)
This paragraph discusses the theme.

This paragraph is not affected by the previous annotation.
```

#### 1.6.4 Custom Scope

Using brackets to explicitly define annotation scope:
```markplot
@@.flashback(@@2012-28-02)[
This content is a flashback,
spanning multiple paragraphs,
regardless of the document structure.
]

Normal narrative continues here.
```

Tools processing these annotations should respect these scope rules when analyzing or transforming the text.

### 1.7 Hidden Markdown Structures

MarkPlot allows embedding Markdown syntax that will be processed for analysis but won't appear in the final text. This is achieved through a special syntax using the null entity:

```markplot
@@.(# Hidden Title)
Normal visible text continues here...
```

#### 1.7.1 Syntax

The syntax follows this pattern:
- Must use the null entity (`@@.`)
- Markdown syntax is enclosed in parentheses
- Can be used with any valid Markdown syntax

Examples:
```markplot
@@.(# Act One)
@@.(## Scene 1)
The story begins...

@@.(* Important theme starting here)
She took his @@.(**)[trembling] hand.

@@.(> These words are significant)
Words that will appear normally.
```

#### 1.7.2 Processing

- These structures are processed as regular Markdown during analysis
- They contribute to document structure and metadata
- They are completely removed from the final text
- Tools should treat them as equivalent to their visible Markdown counterparts for analysis purposes

#### 1.7.3 Use Cases

- Invisible document structure
- Literary analysis markers
- Working notes and annotations
- Alternative organization schemes
- Hidden emphasis for analysis

Example of complex usage:
```markplot
@@.(# Chapter 1).Status(draft)
@@.(## Opening Scene).Type(scene)[
    @@Jules.Character[walked through] @@Paris.Place.

    @@.(* Character introduction)
    His @@.(**)[determined] stride revealed his state of mind.
]
```

### 1.8 Interaction with Markdown

MarkPlot annotations are processed before Markdown formatting:

```markplot
**@@Jules.happy**     # Becomes "**Jules**"
@@**Jules.happy**     # Remains "@@**Jules.happy**"
```

This ensures consistent behavior and allows Markdown formatting to be applied to the final text.

## 2. Processing and Workflow

### 2.1 Parser Types and Processing Chain

MarkPlot parsers can be categorized into two main types:

1. **Analysis Parsers**: These parsers read and interpret annotations to extract information, build entity graphs, analyze relationships, or generate derived content (character sheets, timelines, etc.). They represent the core use case of MarkPlot annotations.

2. **Production Parsers**: While not the primary focus of MarkPlot, these parsers can transform the text for specific outputs. Since they allow enriching the writing possibilities without interrupting the writing flow, they are a welcome extension of MarkPlot's capabilities.

A fundamental rule applies to ALL parsers: they MUST preserve ALL annotations intact in their output, even when transforming the text. This ensures that:
- Each parser can interpret any annotation according to its own rules
- Multiple interpretations of the same annotations remain possible throughout the chain
- Annotations remain available for subsequent parsers

The only exception to this rule is the Cleanup Parser, which is specifically designed to remove all annotations at the end of the processing chain to produce the final human-readable text.

### 2.2 Cleanup Parser

The Cleanup Parser is a special parser responsible for removing visible MarkPlot annotations from the text. It has specific characteristics that distinguish it from other parsers:

#### 2.2.1 Position in the Chain

The Cleanup Parser:
- Must be the last MarkPlot parser in any processing chain
- Can only be used once in a chain

#### 2.2.2 Operation Scope

The Cleanup Parser:
- Resolves visible entity names (e.g., converting @@Jules_Durant to "Jules Durant")
- Removes all visible MarkPlot annotations
- When an annotation is removed during the cleanup process, if its removal leaves an empty line in the output, that empty line should also be removed automatically to ensures that no unnecessary blank lines are present in the final document.

### 2.3 Error Handling

MarkPlot follows a permissive approach to error handling:

1. **Invalid Syntax**: Any text that cannot be interpreted as valid MarkPlot syntax is treated as regular content and left unchanged:
```markplot
@@[Invalid syntax] remains "@@[Invalid syntax]"
@Jules (missing @) remains "@Jules"
```

2. **Partial Annotations**: Incomplete annotations (unclosed bracket or parenthesis)  preserved as-is:
```markplot
@@Jules[unclosed bracket becomes "Jules[unclosed bracket"
```
3. **Unknown Modifiers**: While there are no "invalid" modifiers syntactically, modifiers that are neither standard nor from a registered application namespace are simply removed during cleanup:
```markplot
@@Jules.unknownModifier[text] becomes "Jules text"
```

This approach ensures that:
- Writing flow is never interrupted
- Content is never lost
- Manual correction remains possible
- Valid annotations are still processed even in presence of invalid ones

## 3. Implementation Guidelines and Best Practices

### 3.1 Parser Implementation

#### 3.1.1 Parser Design

- Keep parsers single-purpose and composable
- Ensure parsers are stateless when possible
- Implement clear error handling and reporting
- Support streaming processing for large documents

#### 3.1.2 Entity Handling

- Store entity references in a case-sensitive manner
- Maintain bi-directional entity relationships
- Index all entity occurrences with their context, including file name and line number

#### 3.1.3 Error Recovery

- Continue processing after non-critical errors
- Maintain document integrity during partial failures
- Provide clear error context for debugging
- Support graceful degradation of features

### 3.2 Tool Creation Guidelines

When creating tools that support MarkPlot, consider these key aspects:

#### 3.2.1 User Interface Design

- Keep the annotation process as natural as typing
- Avoid forcing users to use dialog boxes or menus for basic annotations
- Provide visual feedback without being intrusive
- Consider offering both keyboard shortcuts and mouse interactions

#### 3.2.2 Entity Management

- Provide easy ways to browse and search existing entities
- Allow quick entity reuse without breaking the writing flow
- Consider auto-completion for entity names
- Enable easy entity renaming with proper refactoring

#### 3.2.3 Real-time Features

- Implement incremental parsing for large documents
- Consider background analysis for complex operations
- Provide immediate visual feedback for annotations
